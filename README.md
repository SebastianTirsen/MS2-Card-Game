## Design

**Colours**

The two dominating colours in this game are the ones that are on the background image. Mainly black and green. The other colours used are white for the navigation and modal emanating from Bootstrap and standard orange for the buttons.

**Typography**

The Quicksand font is the main font used throughout the whole site with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Quicksand have round shaped ends to the characters and is striking yet playfull. Its fits this game perfectly.

**Imagery**

The Logo icon is reminiscent of the movies Jurassic Park and is tasteful yet strong in black on white background. 

The Hero image are the most important picture that sets the mood of the entire site and this game. The terrifying Tyrannousaurus Rex roaring in the background makes an impact on the players to get them excited to play the game. 

The Card images are a very important part of making this game enjoyable to play. The picture cannot be to detailed or to plain, the balance must be just right between detail and simplicity to make them easy but not too easy to remember. 

The image in the modal is a celebration of the players victory. And what better way is there to celebrate than Fireworks? 


## Wireframes

One initial wireframe was done in Adobe XD. After that no further work with the Wireframe was done. The reason was the simplicity of the idea and that it was not neccessary to change the design significantly during the project.

## Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

**First time players goals**

1. As a first time player of this game you want to have quick access to the rules and understand how the game is played.
  * The first page contains clear and visible navigation buttons and one of them is named "Rules" and leads to the Rules page where all the neccessary information about playing the game is stated in white on black.

2. As a first time player you want it to be easy to start up the game and try it out a couple of times at level one to test the difficulty and your own ability to memorize.
  * If you like you can start playing directly by choosing level by pressing a levelbutton on the first page.

3. As a first time player you want to see your results, your time to finish the game.
  * After finishing a game a big beatiful modal shows up and congratulates the player and states the time in which he/she finished the game. In the modal the player have two buttons with choices of playing the same level again or choosing another level by returning to the first page and then clicking on a different level button.

**Returning players goals**

1. As a returning player you want to compare your results with your own previous results to see if you have improved you capability.
  * The clearly visible modal always shows up at the end of the game and informs the player of the the time it took to finish.

2. As a returning player you want to try the more difficult levels two and three to see if you can master them too.
  * There are three levels clearly visible on the first page for the player to choose between three different levels of difficulty. The difference is the number of cards that the player is supposed to match. Level One is comprised of twelve cards making up six pairs. Level Two is comprised of sixteen cards making up eight pairs. Level Three is comprised of twenty cards making up ten pairs. 

3. As a returning player you want to be able to compete with your friends and try to beat each others time to finish the game.
  * The game is easy to navigate and restart when finished. Just invite a friend and compare times. Who is the fastest?


**Frequent players goals**

1. As a frequent player you want to be able to improve your memory skills and have an even faster time to finish than last time. 
  * The game is easy to navigate and restart when finished. Level three can be quite a challenge to finish fast and is great practice for your memory.

2. As a frequent player you want to be able to easily get in contact with the creators of the game to ask questions and to give suggestions on how to improve the game.
  * The contact page is easily accessible and gives the player a direct link for communicating questions, requests and suggestions to the creators of the game. The player simply states their full name, email and writes a comment in the textfield. When pressing the send-button the player gets feedback that the mail is sent  by the send-button changing text to "Message sent".

3. As a frequent player you want to be able to request to the creators to increase the difficulty, for example by decreasing the time the cards are showing their front side before flipping back over.
  * The contact page is easily accessible and gives the player a direct link for communicating questions, requests and suggestions to the creators of the game.
  * The code is commented such a way that another developer easily can alter the number of cards in the game or the time the cardfronts are shown.

## Further Testing

The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.

The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Ipad Pro, Ipad, iPhoneX, iPhone 6/7/8 and Iphone 5/SE.

A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all the cards were working correctly and that the game shuffled when the player restarts the game to play again.

My family members were asked to review the site and play the game to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.


## Performance

Lighthouse:

# Bugs & fixes

To many bugs to mention when writing the Javascript. Here are a few:

When connecting the timer to the Javascript to make the timer start when the first card was clicked. This caused several bugs.

At one point I could not get the cards to shuffle when the player restarts. I had put the code in the wrong place and when moving it, the bug was solved.

A design and responsive issue that **I did not fix**. The pages breaks up when viewed on Iphone 5 or smaller screens.

An error ocurred when i was working in github and gitpod at the same time. I accidentally tried to push the code from both places and that caused a conflict. I solved it by copying from an old commit and pushing from locally stored code.
