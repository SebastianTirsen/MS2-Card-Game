## Design

**Colours**

The two dominating colours in this game are the ones that are on the background image. Mainly black and green. The other colours used are white for the navigation and modal emanating from Bootstrap and standard orange for the buttons.

**Typography**

The Quicksand font is the main font used throughout the whole site with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Quicksand have round shaped ends to the characters and is striking yet playfull. Its fits this game perfectly.

**Imagery**

The Logo icon is reminiscent of the movies Jurassic Park and is tasteful yet strong in black on white background. Logo icon from:

The Hero image are the most important picture that sets the mood of the entire site and this game. The terrifying Tyrannousaurus Rex roaring int the background makes an impact on the players to get them excited to play the game. Hero image from:

The Card images are a very important part of making this game enjoyable to play. The picture cannot be to detailed or to plain, the balance must be just right between detail and simplicity to make them easy but not too easy to remember. Card images from:

The image in the modal is a celebration of the players victory. And what better way is there to celebrate than Fireworks? Fireworks in modal from:

## Wireframes

One initial wireframe was done in Adobe XD. After that no further work with the Wireframe was done. The reason was the simplicity of the idea and also the lack of time.
